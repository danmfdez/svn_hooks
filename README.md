## Getting Started

You can manage all your hooks in a single location and deploy them in the different repositories only by editing a single(\*) configuration file (hooks.cfg).  
(\*) Some hooks scripts have their own configuration file.


### Prerequisites

You need to have Subversion server installed. This scripts have been tested in Collabnet Subversion Edge.


### Installing

- Copy 'pre' and 'post' folders to your SVN installation path (e.g. /opt/csvn/hooks/).
- Rename 'hooks.cfg.example' file to 'hooks.cfg' in 'hooks' directory of each repository where you want to use hooks. Edit the file according to your needs.
- Create a link to pre-commit or/and post-commit file in pre and post folder en each hooks repository folder do you want to activate hooks.

```shell
    mkdir /opt/csvn/hooks/
    cp -R pre pro /opt/csvn/hooks/
    cp hooks.cfg.example /opt/csvn/data/repositories/<repo>/hooks/hooks.cfg
    ln -s /opt/csvn/data/repositories/<repo>/hooks/pre-commit /opt/csvn/hooks/pre/pre-commit
    ln -s /opt/csvn/data/repositories/<repo>/hooks/post-commit /opt/csvn/hooks/post/post-commit
```
